Technologies Used

Front-End





React: A JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.



Custom CSS: Handwritten CSS for styling components, ensuring a lightweight and tailored design.



JavaScript (ES6+): Modern JavaScript for handling application logic and interactivity.



React Router: For seamless client-side navigation between pages like Home, Product Details, and Cart (if implemented).

Back-End (Optional)





The project may integrate with a back-end service (e.g., Node.js, Firebase, or a REST API) to handle product data, user authentication, and order processing. If no back-end is included, product data is mocked or stored locally (e.g., in JSON files).



Axios/Fetch: Used for making API calls to fetch product or user data (if a back-end is implemented).

Authentication





User Authentication: If implemented, the app supports user login and registration, potentially using a back-end service like Firebase Authentication or a custom API. This allows users to access personalized features such as saving cart items or viewing order history.



If authentication is not implemented, the app operates in a guest mode with core e-commerce features available without login.
